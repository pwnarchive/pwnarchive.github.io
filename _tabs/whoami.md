I’m an aspiring cybersecurity professional, constantly learning and sharpening my skills in offensive security and pentesting.
I created this blog as my personal logbook, a place where I document machines I’ve worked on, techniques I’m exploring, or any topic that helps me grow in the field you name it.
It’s not meant to be perfect, just notes from my journey as I keep developing and aiming to get better every day.
